Ðšeeping in mind that the game is a student project it will not be uploaded to google play or apple store...for now. BUT if you have python programming experience and want to continue developing your skills with a framework then kivy is a pretty cool choice for creating decent games.

Let's start with the very basics. So what prerequisites do you need to run the project?:

 - Python programming language
 - Integrated development environment (preferable is Pycharm)
 - Know-how to configure interpreter (System one and the one for Virtual environment)
 - WSL == Linux on your Windows machine
 - Ubuntu
 - adb server
